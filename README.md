# Housing_Price_Prediction
In this project, I have made use of basic machine learning tools to predict the housing price in delhi. I have here used Random Forest, Decision Tree, Ridge Regressor and Linear Regression to compare as whichone of them would provide a more accurate result.
Based on the Data I have Decision Tree provided the best accuracy so it was used in the prediction model.
